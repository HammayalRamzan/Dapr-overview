# 🌐 Dapr Overview

## 🔹 What is Dapr?

**Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)** is an open-source, portable, event-driven runtime that simplifies building microservices-based distributed applications.

It provides a set of **standardized APIs** to solve common challenges in microservices architecture such as:

- Service-to-service communication  
- State management  
- Publish/Subscribe messaging  
- Observability  
- Secrets management  
- Actor-based programming model

## 💡 Why Use Dapr?

Dapr helps developers by:

- ✅ Simplifying microservice development  
- 🌍 Enabling portability across cloud and on-prem environments  
- 🧪 Supporting any programming language  
- 🔌 Providing pluggable components (e.g., Redis, Kafka, AWS S3)  
- 🔄 Handling retries, encryption, observability, and resiliency  
- ⚡ Supporting event-driven architecture out of the box  

---

## 🌍 Scope of Dapr

Dapr is ideal for:

- Enterprise microservices systems  
- Cloud-native development (Kubernetes, Docker)  
- Edge computing applications  
- Serverless and event-driven architectures  
- IoT ecosystems  
- Hybrid cloud solutions  

The scope is growing as more companies adopt **distributed systems** and **cloud-native** patterns.
